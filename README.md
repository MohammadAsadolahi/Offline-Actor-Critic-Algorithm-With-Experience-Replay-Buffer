# Offline-Actor-Critic-Algorithm-With-Experience-Replay-Buffer
Combining experience replay buffer whith Actor-Critic algorithm to expedite learning procedure by offline learning
This codde is a single Actor-critic Agent deployed along with a experience replay buffer which is comonly used in off-policy reinforcement algorithms  
**this project can be applied for !any on-policy Actor-Critic algorithm! to expedite learning procedure**   
**this project is a research project and owners have no responsibility of any loss for deploying this project in real environmentn**

**this code is implemented with Pytorch! i will add TensorFlow version soon!!**
### to do:  
* deploy the ReplayBuffer code   [***done***]
* add imports file   [***done***]
* deploy Value neural network [***done***]
* deploy Policy neural network
* deploy the Agnet in pytorch 
* deploy the Environmetn class (using OpenAI Gym library) 
* deploy the main learning loop
* deploy the test loop
* run a standard RL evaluation
